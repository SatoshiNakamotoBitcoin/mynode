## Upgrading your myNode
Once you are running myNode, you can easily [update the software](https://mynodebtc.github.io/device/upgrading-device.html) yourself!


## Developing for myNode

### Developing the myNode Platform
See the [development guide](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode/blob/master/doc/development.md).

### Adding new Applications to myNode
To develop and add new applications to mynode, check out the [Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_sdk).


## Install on Existing System (beta)
To setup a new device on a supported platform that is already running Linux (Raspi4, RockPi 4, RockPro64, PC, ...), you can run two simple commands.

First, install a debian-based operating system.

Second, login and run these two commands.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mynodebtc/mynode/master/setup/setup_device.sh -O mynode_setup.sh
sudo bash ./mynode_setup.sh online
```

Once the script successfully completed, reboot and you will be running myNode!

## What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a unique form of digital money that enables users to send money over the Internet securely without the need for banks or other 3rd parties. This enables anyone with Internet access the ability to participate in the global economy no matter where they live - anywhere from rural Africa to Venezuela to Antarctica to space!

Bitcoin is also unique in that it is deflationary and only has a finite amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist - 21 million. This is similar to land or other valuable natural resources that are limited in their supply. This limited supply is based on computer software algorithms built into the Bitcoin protocol. No person, company, or government can change that limit. This makes Bitcoin valuable to many people who want to save money.

The Lightning Network is another layer on top of Bitcoin, speeding up the rate at which Bitcoin can be sent. Bitcoin transactions are very secure, but can take time to fully confirm. The Lightning Network allows people to send Bitcoin back and forth without the need to wait for each transaction to be included in a Bitcoin block.

There is much more to Bitcoin and the Lighting Network than is mentioned here. For more information, start with these links.

## Security
There are many reasons to run a Bitcoin Node. It helps keep the Bitcoin network secure and reduces the trust you are giving others when using 3rd party Bitcoin Explorers or Bitcoin Light Wallet servers. They can track you or give you false information, reducing your security and privacy. A “full node”, like the Bitcoin node running on your myNode device, personally validates all blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain making sure your Bitcoin transactions and Lightning network use is built on the strongest, most trusted foundation possible.

By using myNode for your Lightning Wallet, Bitcoin Wallet, and Block Explorer, you no longer have to trust others to give you the correct information! This increases your security when protecting your valuable assets.

Please note, myNode is not responsible for any lost funds while using your device. We have taken significant measures to protect your assets by securing myNode, but lightning wallets are meant to be online and used for spending where risks are greater. Please do your own research into Bitcoin and the Lightning Network before investing in cryptocurrency.

For long term storage of cryptocurrency assets, please consider using a hardware wallet, like a Ledger or Trezor.

## Community
myNode has a wonderful, helpful community that assists with development and support. It would be impossible to run this project without their involvement and support! The effort they put in to make this, and all Bitcoin projects, a success is truly appreciated.

## Bounties
It takes a lot of work to add new features and maintain myNode. In order to provide desired features, improve documentation, and help provide the best product possible, some new features and improvements have bounties associsated with them. If anyone in the community would like to implement improvements, they can claim the bounty.

## License
The primary myNode License is a variation of CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 with some modifications in Section 9.
