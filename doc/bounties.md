## Migration Tool
Known active efforts: none

Payout: 1,000,000 sats (0.01 BTC)

With the growing number of node options available, some users would like to migrate more easily to myNode. I would be nice if the following user experience was possible, allowing migrate of critical data to a new myNode setup.

- Boot myNode with RaspiBlitz or Umbrel drive
- Prompt user to migrate drive
- If confirmed
  - Update the drive to use myNode drive folder format
  - Move Bitcoin data
  - Migrate Lightning data
  - Move old data to backup folder (optional, depends on size)
- Reboot

Alternatively, create two tools to more easily import data specifically for LND and Bitcoin.

For example, a tool to import a tarball of LND data + prompt for existing password to put in the .lndpw file. For bitcoin, possibly a page to prompt for a server + password to SCP files from or a way to upload a tarball.

## Add BIP 158 Toggle 

Completed: https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode/pull/596

Payout: 200k sats

It may be beneficial to some users to enable block filters so addresses can be scanned faster. A toggle should be made available on the Bitcoin page to enable block filters (blockfilterindex=1). Changing this would probably need to reboot the node and the user should be prompted for confirmation prior to saving. The toggle should look similar to the watchtower toggle on the LND page.

This does take extra disk space the creating the it may take some time. The user should be appropriately warned of the tradeoffs.
